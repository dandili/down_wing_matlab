# Fluid Flow Field Visualization in MATLAB

## Description
This repository provides MATLAB scripts for visualizing fluid flow fields in 3D, using data from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. It includes scripts for generating various visualizations like 2D contour plots, 3D scatter plots, quiver plots, and isosurface plots to represent different flow parameters, offering insights into the complex behaviors and patterns in fluid flows.

## Data
The sample data used in these scripts, `WingDownResults.txt`, is provided courtesy of the Mathworks MATLAB and Simulink Racing Lounge.

## Visualizations
- **2D Contour Plots:** Visualize scalar fields like pressure and velocity magnitude on specified planes.
- **3D Scatter Plots:** Explore the spatial distribution of scalar quantities in 3D space.
- **Quiver Plots:** Analyze the vector field of velocities in 3D to understand flow directions and magnitudes.
- **Isosurface Plots:** Examine the 3D distribution of scalar quantities like pressure and velocity magnitude.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Run the scripts individually to generate the corresponding visualizations, ensuring MATLAB has access to `WingDownResults.txt`.
4. Customize the visualization scripts as needed to adapt to other datasets or specific visualization requirements.
